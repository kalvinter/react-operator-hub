# Welcome to the Grid
Step into the role of a reactor operator at the heart of the nation's power grid. Your mission? 
Keep the country powered up! But remember, it's all about balance: match the country's electricity demand without overloading the system.

### Gameplay Essentials
Your reactor relies on <b>fuel</b> to generate electricity. The more fuel you use, the hotter the reactor becomes, leading to increased power output.
<b>Stay vigilant!</b> <b>Demand</b> can fluctuate based on various events, such as other reactors going offline. 
These events will be highlighted at the top of your screen.

<strong>Quick Tips for Power Mastery:</strong>
<ul className='list-inside list-disc'>
    <li>Adding fuel boosts power but also heats up the reactor.</li>
    <li>A hotter reactor means a faster reaction-factor, giving you more power.</li>
    <li>If things heat up too much, up the cooling level to keep things stable.</li>
    <li>Always be on the lookout for events affecting power demand.</li>
    <li>Earn points by maintaining power production within the optimal green zone.</li>
</ul>

# About the Repository

This repository is an experiment to practice working with react. It is a constant work-in-progress and more of a playground for myself than a production-ready project. Use the code with care



# Usage
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kalvinter/react-reactor-game.git
cd react-reactor-game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a development server with vite
npm run dev

# Build the final project
npm run build
```
