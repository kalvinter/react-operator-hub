# Welcome to the Grid

Step into the role of a reactor operator at the heart of the nation's power grid. Your mission?
Keep the country powered up! But remember, it's all about balance: match the country's electricity demand without overloading the system.

### Gameplay Essentials

Your reactor relies on <b>fuel</b> to generate electricity. The more fuel you use, the hotter the reactor becomes, leading to increased power output.
<b>Stay vigilant!</b> <b>Demand</b> can fluctuate based on various events, such as other reactors going offline.
These events will be highlighted at the top of your screen.

### Quick Tips for Power Mastery:

<ul className='list-inside list-disc'>
    <li>Adding fuel boosts power but also heats up the reactor.</li>
    <li>A hotter reactor means a faster reaction-factor, giving you more power.</li>
    <li>If things heat up too much, up the cooling level to keep things stable.</li>
    <li>Always be on the lookout for events affecting power demand.</li>
    <li>Earn points by maintaining power production within the optimal green zone.</li>
</ul>
